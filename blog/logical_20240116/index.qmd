When december arrives I usually make plans for my christmas vacation. Typically, 
I choose a book that has nothing to do with my work, or has little overlap with 
the usual topics I encounter at work. Sometimes this works better, sometimes worse. 
During the year in regular weeks, I don´t find the time to read.
However, these year I had not the time and the muse to do the research for 
finding a book which gets me through the holidays. So while cleaning up I 
stumbled over a magazine I bought 6 months ago for a train ride. 
This magazine is full with logicals and riddels and it is called: 
[P.M. Logiktrainer](https://shop.pm-magazin.de/de_DE/abo/pm-logik-trainer/p.m.-logik-trainer-wunschabo/13863.html#oc=selbstzahler). 

So, Christmas arrived and I sat down and tried to solve the following logical.
HIER BILD EINFÜGEN.


```{r}
#| eval: false

a <- 1
summary(a)

```
