1) Memory Recall: okay.
2) Social Conformity: okay. this could work but i think it is not so easy to administrate for the students.
3) Bystander Effect: That is not easy to perform.
4) Stroop Effect: okay. to measure the error rate, a computer is necessry but it is doable.
5) Visual Perception: hm okay. i can not imagine an example.
6) Priming and Cognitive Processing: okay yes.
7) Learning Styles and Retention: no. this is too much effort for the students.
8) Mood's Effect on Creativity: too hard to create an experiment
9) The Halo Effect: I find it hard to create such an experiment
10) Sleep and Cognitive Performance: too hard to find people who monitor the sleep.
